# TomatoSuperPanGenome

Here, we sequence and de novo assemble chromosome-scale genomes of nine wild species and two cultivated accessions of tomato, and construct a super-pangenome, revealing phylogenetic relationships and structural variation among _Solanum_ section _Lycopersicon_. Comparative analyses reveal extensive variation among the tomato wild species, empowering the identification of a wild-type allele presenting potential values for yield improvement in modern cultivated tomatoes.
